                    \"Quality maintenance is hard to find around there.\" That's apparently all the explanation HQ thought you needed, before shipping you off to a planet you'd never even heard of.\n\
                    Six days later, your ship arrived nose-first a couple of miles from the site after a close shave with an asteroid belt. It's in no state to fly any time soon, but this is a year-long assignment, so you weren't too concerned.\n\
                    You made your way to your residence- and workplace-to-be.<br><br>\n\
                    After checking in past the guards, and changing out of your flight suit into your maintenance overalls, the receptionist sent you straight to the service elevator, to check in with the onsite officer in the basement office.. No introduction, no explanation as to where you were or what this company even did.\n\
                    You thought you noticed a hint of urgency in her voice - maybe climate control in the boardroom was on the fritz.<br><br>\n\
                    As the elevator descended, what sounded like a rather concerning explosion shook the building. As it approached the bottom,  an odd smell filled the air and it became harder and harder for you to breathe.\n\
                    Pulling your shirt up over your mouth, you darted out of the elevator the moment it reached the bottom. Toxic fumes were billowing into the room, and rubble was everywhere. Anyone who was working down here had presumably managed to flee before the explosion hit.\n\
                    You managed to dive into the maintenance office - which, mercifully, still had clean air inside it - and seal the door behind you, before passing out.<br><br>\n\
                    When you came to, you surveyed the room. Most of the systems were offline, but a diagnostic panel was still functioning. From that you got a basic sense of the situation: power and life support to the building had failed after some kind of impact or explosion, and only basic systems were online.\n\
                    The entirety of the staff had evacuated, leaving you alone in a facility you'd arrived at today...assuming this was even still the same day. To make matters worse, the facility had automatically locked the basement down to contain the issue, and without power lifting the blast doors would be impossible. You were trapped down here.<br><br>\n\
                    Waiting seemed pointless, so you took a look through the schematics in the room. It looks as though the corridor surrounding this room houses the life support system - and if you could get that back online, you'd be able to set up some power generation from the components here.\n\
                    You managed to piece together a basic respirator, and found a portable air tank you could take with you. It'd only let you stay out for a few moments but it should be enough to start working on repairs. Better than waiting for a rescue that might never come."]]
