23. Create functionality for generator loop automation node (presets, mass changes etc.)
24. Implement mining spots
25. Create functionality for mining node (will require resource balance)

TO DO FOR NEXT RELEASE:

(1) Add a transition screen providing lore and the end 

(2) Implement the "power loop" system that generates power [COMPLETE]
 - (2a) Implement the "generator upgrade" system in each layer C1 through C8
    - This is doable, but I'm not sure if I'll have anything to do with it yet

(3) Write various lore text
 - Story tab update (may match text on (1))
 - Layer rewrites:
   - M
   - C1
   - C2
   - C3
   - C4
   - C5
   - C6
   - C7
   - C8

(4) Add nodes for the installation around the Corridors
Surrounding the corridors should be a number of nodes (16 including 4 doors and 4 walls) with various purposes.

The four corners should be "walls" that will lead out to, eventually, the (something) received from the four (something). I think.
The four orthogonal midpoints are exits (NX for "north exit" etc.)
The areas inside (marked with **) can be filled with other buildings.
Rough map:

[WW][**][NX][**][WW]
[**][C8][C1][C2][**]
[WX][C7][MT][C3][EX]
[**][C6][C5][C4][**]
[WW][**][SX][**][WW]


(5) Add the buildings themselves
The 12 building slots should provide some utility to the player. These will unlock as they progress through the game.
Ideas for buildings...
[A] "Suit Maintenance"
Available to activate from the start.
This is where you find the suit that lets you Venture Out outside the base.
Initially just lets you get the suit, but over time you can amend its properties.
[B] "Neural Implants"
Allows for mind-altering upgrades.
I suspect this is where I'll put the QoL upgrades (slower/stopped time when not acting)
[C] "Fabrication"
Allows creation of components.
My thinking is this is where new oxygen tanks, etc, could be crafted (or uncrafted!).
Not sure on the balance yet.
[D] "Transportation"(? Not sure about this one in light of other changes)
Creation or maintenance of vehicle to travel across the areas more easily.
In practice, a speed boost to exploration and maybe a way to cross impassable terrain
[E] "Outpost Control"
Name probably needs work.
This bad boy would let you make oxygen outposts in the desert and shit, so you can go resupply.
Potentially power cost per supported outpost.
[F] "Automation"
Internal automation. Allows for mass generator changes and preset saving from "M".
Not sure what if anything else it could also do.
[G] ???
[H] ???

(6) Implement the "climb the tower" tree.
 As the tower is back online it should be possible for the player to climb it.
 This will represent the elevator shaft, whose max height is dependent on the energy developed below (probably 10^x for layer)
