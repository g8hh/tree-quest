NEURAL IMPLANT IDEAS:

1. CALM MIND
 - The rate at which time passes when idle is slowed by 25% per implant.
 - Up to 4 implants are possible for a complete reduction.
 A: granted upon prologue completion
 B: granted if prologue challenge (skip 2nd tank) completed

2. PERFECT RECALL
 - When performing an action, you can view other nodes without interrupting the action.
 - One implant available, all or nothing

3. TIME COMPRESSION
 - When performing an action, time progresses at a faster rate (both oxygen consumption and action progress)
 - This could have multiple stages as well, maybe? +0.5x or +1x per upgrade, or even *2x per upgrade, I dunno

4. MUSCLE MEMORY
 - Once implanted, your best time to reach a given space is stored. You can revisit the space in that time by clicking.
 - Multiple times can be stored, if the time to reach a location included use of an upgrade (e.g. CALM MIND, or a transportation upgrade)
