Current plan is to have four "temples" representing
 each of the four standard elements, roughly set up as follows:
 [N] AIR
 [E] FIRE
 [W] WATER
 [S] EARTH

Once opened, each temple will connect to the walls (somehow).


AIR TREE
========

The air tree will start from the bottom and go up.

Idea dumps:
[AIR]
Wind(?)
Turbine
Tunnel
Steam
Bird?? (Phoenix as fire+air maybe)
Storm

Its base resource is determined from your oxygen tanks.
The tanks would have to be "left" in the tree to start it.

Layers:

(OX) OXYGEN (next to bottom, row 0)

(A) AIR (bottom)

(TB) Turbines

(TN) Tunnels

(WI) Wind (Acquisition of wind will allow for removal of air)



FIRE TREE
=========

The fire tree will start from the left and go right.

Idea dumps:
[FIRE]
Lava
Ash
Phoenix
Coal


Its base resource is determined from your "inefficiency".
The wasted energy from the loop will be calculated as heat.

Layers:

(WE) WASTED ENERGY (next to left, row 0)

(F) FIRE (left)

(SL) Solar Lensing (Acquisition will replace WE))

(FU) Fuel

(MA) Magma

 

 WATER

 Idea dumps:
 [WATER]
 Stream
 Sea
 Tsunami
 Ice (Water + Earth???)
 Cloud (Water + Air???)


 EARTH

 Idea dumps:
 [EARTH]
 Coal? (Earth + Fire?)
 Grass/Tree/etc ("life" earth angle)
