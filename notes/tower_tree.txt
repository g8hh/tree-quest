TOWER TREE
==========

Upon unlocking Chapter 1 [and completing X condition?],
 you will gain the ability to climb the "Tower Tree".
 This tree represents climbing the layers of the company.
 Its initial production is based on the generator loop.

INITIAL PRODUCTION

The bottom "G" layer ["Generator"?] will have base production
 taken from the generator loop in the Corridors.
 There are a number of ways I could do this...
 [1] Loop power
  - Just take the loop power from below
   {Average} Mean of all 8 nodes
   {Lowest} Worst of the nodes
   {Highest} Best of the nodes
 [2] Loop inefficiency
  - Instead of the gain, store the percentage decrease from loop
  {Average} Mean of nodes
  {Total} Sum of all 8 nodes' inefficiency


LAYERS

I need to think of actual layers fuck
