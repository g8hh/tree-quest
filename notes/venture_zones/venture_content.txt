General notes on venture content
=====================================

Generic things you can find whilst venturing:

1. Resources
 There'll be various resource deposits scattered around. These resources can be spent on various things back at base.
 Collecting a resource will add it to your inventory and allow you to spend it.
 A task can be completed to manually mine/harvest/etc the resource. This will take longer to do for each item harvested.
 Suit can be upgraded to allow for better gathering.
 Later on, it'll be possible to build mining/harvesting equipment on the site to autocollect, but this will need to be upgraded or powered to get deeper materials.

2. Outposts
 Once the outpost building is unlocked it'll be possible to restore oxygen at certain outposts.
 Current plan is for it to fill oxygen up to the "current tank", e.g. if you have 3 tanks 20s apiece, and 31s oxygen left, it fills the 2nd tank (ceil(31/20) = 2) to give 40s oxygen
 In addition, it would serve as a safe zone to catch one's breath even if they lacked the Calm Mind neural imprint

3. Solvable Obstacles
 Akin to the task sequence idea from the Prologue, these will be a series of sequences that will allow for paths to be opened or effects to occur.
 Examples vary, but might include a key or switch to a door, or a bridge to be lowered over a gap

4. Terrain Obstacles
 These are obstacles matching the theme of one of the four elements. Rather than solving them with a task sequence they'll require equipment to bypass.
 Obstacles will each have a type (air/water/earth/fire) and a level (0 at the easiest, up to 3).
 Passing a level 0 obstacle will require possession of the necessary transport equipment.
 Passing higher level obstacles will require imbuement of the equipment with elemental resource from the corresponding temple/tree.



Specific landmarks found whilst venturing:

1. Entrance
 This is at the "innermost" point of each slice of the circle.
 It serves as the "M layer"/"base" for exploring that layer.
 When clicking the door from inside, and choosing to "go outside", you will be able to see the layout of that layer.
 Then clicking "go inside" would return you to the central area.
 When outside, you can "Venture Out" again, which starts the timer much like inside.

2. Temple
 This is at the "outermost" end of each slice of the circle.
 It's the entrance to the "dungeon" of that element.
 At first it will only just be reachable, and opening it will (probably) activate the bottom-most tier of that element's generation.

3. Side Doors
 Each "slice" has a door in each side of the wall, leading to the next "slice".
 These doors will be obscured somehow (probably with a mix of Terrain and Solvable Obstacles).
 I might make the doors sealed from the outside until opened once from their corresponding layer.
 (e.g. you'd need to open F>A door from F side and A>F door from A side)
