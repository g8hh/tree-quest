THE "P" LAYER

(1) Viewable Information
 Currently the "P" layer is used as a mass storage area for gameplay variables ("Progress"). It should also have its own uses:
 - Inventory: A view of any items that have been picked up (including Fuses, oxygen tanks, and keys)
 - Story: An overview of the story so far
 - Challenges: If I decide to put them in, a list of "challenges" or achievements that can be attempted throughout the run


PROLOGUE CHANGES STILL TO COMPLETE:

(2) Information Display:
 It should be possible to see some information in a couple of places:
 - The current and total amount of Fuses should be visible on the "M" layer once at least one Fuse is owned [COMPLETE]
 - The current and total oxygen tanks should also be displayed on the "M" layer, as this is where oxygen is refilled.


(4) Story and Descriptions:
 Currently there is no guidance on any of the layers. This removes an element of immersion, but most importantly makes C1 through C8 FUCKING BORING.
 - Each layer should have a section for text that will describe the area. This will also offer some additional guidance, especially in the case of the "M" layer.

 M layer:
 - pre-fusebox
 - post-fusebox
 C1 layer:
 - pre-fusebox
 - post-fusebox
 C2 layer
 C3 layer
 C4 layer
 C5 layer
 C6 layer
 C7 layer
 C8 layer

(5) Intro Screen:
 As this plays differently from most Prestige Tree mods, it would be appropriate to have a start/disclaimer screen before beginning the run.
 - The endgame screen could be repurposed for this, or a similar screen created.

(6) Help Layer:
 Implement a side layer named "H" to contain help documents


"CHAPTER 1" CHANGES TO COMPLETE

(1) Add an upgrade to "M" to activate the life support system
This will initiate the shift out of "Prologue" mode into "Chapter 1" mode... (From a story perspective, there will likely be a small timeskip here.)
Sub-steps:
[1] SANITY CHECK: [COMPLETE]
 It's possible to complete the Prologue with only two out of the three oxygen tanks (the starter and one additional) so a third should be added.
 This can be explained as retrieving the third tank once life support is active, as part of maintenance to the building.
 If I implement achievements, the first of them would be for this (though it would also have an alternative method of completion) and would likely grant a QoL upgrade early.
[2] DISABLE ALL THE PROLOGUE SHIT [COMPLETE...I think]
 Make it so anything prologue-only (e.g. the fusebox) is inaccessible
[3] TRANSITION SCREEN?
 Maybe add a transition screen to give information about the power up and the timeskip (if I have one)

(2) Implement the "power loop" system that generates power [COMPLETE]
This applies some effect to the "points" variables of each layer C1 through C8.
The function powerCycle() is called for each layer in turn, and each layer takes the previous layer's output as its input, meaning values will eventually normalise.

(3) Implement the "generator upgrade" system in each layer C1 through C8
There should be an option on each layer to install a new type of generator, once the necessary (whatever) has been found.
This will change the generatorType property of that layer, thus changing the effect applied to the layer in the powerCycle() function.
The premise of this is to allow for swapping the generators around to prioritise certain nodes or otherwise bump up statistics.

(4) Add nodes for the installation around the Corridors
Surrounding the corridors should be a number of nodes (potentially as many as 12 or 16) with various purposes.

The four corners should be "walls" that will lead out to, eventually, the (something) received from the four (something). I think.
The four orthogonal midpoints are exits (NX for "north exit" etc.)
The areas inside (marked with **) can be filled with other buildings.
Rough map:

[WW][  ][  ][NX][  ][  ][WW]
[  ][WW][**][**][**][WW][  ]
[  ][**][C8][C1][C2][**][  ]
[WX][**][C7][MT][C3][**][EX]
[  ][**][C6][C5][C4][**][  ]
[  ][WW][**][**][**][WW][  ]
[WW][  ][  ][SX][  ][  ][WW}]

(5) Add the buildings themselves
The 12 building slots should provide some utility to the player. These will unlock as they progress through the game.
Ideas for buildings...
[A] "Suit Maintenance"
Available to activate from the start.
This is where you find the suit that lets you Venture Out outside the base.
Initially just lets you get the suit, but over time you can amend its properties.
[B] "Neuro Bay"
Allows for mind-altering upgrades.
I suspect this is where I'll put the QoL upgrades (slower/stopped time when not acting)
[C] "Manufacturing"
Allows creation of components.
My thinking is this is where new oxygen tanks, etc, could be crafted (or uncrafted!).
Not sure on the balance yet.
[D] "Vehicle Bay"
Creation or maintenance of vehicle to travel across the areas more easily.
In practice, a speed boost to exploration and maybe a way to cross impassable terrain
[E] "Outpost Control"
Name probably needs work.
This bad boy would let you make oxygen outposts in the desert and shit, so you can go resupply.
Potentially power cost per supported outpost.
[F] "Automation"
Internal automation. Allows for mass generator changes and preset saving from "M".
Not sure what if anything else it could also do.
[G]
[H]
[I]
[J]
[K]
[L]

(6) Implement the "climb the tower" tree.
 As the tower is back online it should be possible for the player to climb it. This will take the form of a "traditional" prestige tree, but inverted...
 The initial progress will be based on the generator loop below (average power, before deductions).
 As the tower is "climbed" the nodes will provide (a multiplier to the loop generation?) some kind of benefits.


LONGER TERM GOALS (I THINK):

(1) Implement dungeons
There should be "dungeon" areas in which the player has to solve more riddles or some shit idk. These will unlock the (something) mentioned re: the walls above.

(2) Implement "elemental trees"
If I go with my gut idea and have 4 elements as the (something) then each of these should have its own tree.
These will grow independently but be able to be helped by the central power cycle (and in turn, will also help it).

(3) Element-loop interfaces
In theory, the corners (C2/4/6/8) will link to the elemental chambers. Some property of the production from the tree will apply to the loop.
I might even let players choose a node from the tree and use its effect...it depends haha
